# Simulation_Environment

## Description
This project is intented to develop a simulation environment in Python as a proof of concept for an algorithm that can track and reconstruct a localization signal using machine learning and compressive sensing.

## Getting Started

## Prerequisites
Python Anaconda with Spyder IDE is required

## Installation

## Usage Instructions
CSNN framework is the main python script that will run the entire simulation 
it will run the default config if no arguments are given
If a json based file with some values are specified, the default config will be modified accordingly
